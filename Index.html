                  Chicago residents support Cook County Board's Wednesday vote to repeal the penny-per-ounce Sweetened Beverage Tax.
              </h1>
              <p class="dek">
                Led by President Toni Preckwinkle with the support of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the Cook County Board implemented the tax on Aug. 2, 2017. The tax will end at the end of the county fiscal year, at midnight on Nov. 30.

"Bloomberg spent millions pushing this tax under the guise of diabetes, even though [the Board] originally said it was to keep Cook County sheriffs on staff," said Joseph Thurman, a Chicago resident. "If the tax was for healthcare, it would have gone to healthcare -- not Cook County."
</p>

<p>
If Bloomberg and Cook County wanted to prevent health problems, then public officials should have expanded the tax outside of Cook County, and not focus on "a small portion of people," Thurman said.
</p>

<p>
Rajah Varnado, a resident of Chicago, described the repeal as a "relief" because he does not have to pay more for items he is already buying.
</p>

It is possible the Board will increase property taxes to compensate for the repeal, Thurman said. Cook County will try to get any tax money they can from the people of Chicago, said Hailey Douglas, an undergraduate student at DePaul University.
